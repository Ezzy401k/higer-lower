# Higher Lower Game

This Python program is a Higher Lower game where the player has to guess which of two randomly chosen social media profiles has more followers.

## How it Works
The game randomly selects two social media profiles from a predefined list. The player must guess which profile has more followers by typing 'A' or 'B'. For each correct guess, the player earns a point, and the game continues. If the player guesses incorrectly, the game ends, and the final score is displayed. The player can choose to play again or exit the game.

## Features
